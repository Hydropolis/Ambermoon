# Ambermoon

This repository should serve as a place where resources and information about Ambermoon can be stored.

If you have some valuable input, feel free to contact me: trobt@web.de

## Special thanks

Most of the work was done by a bunch of good fellas.
- Oliver Gantert and others of project [Amberworld](http://amberworld.sourceforge.net/)
- Daniel Schulz from [Slothsoft](http://slothsoft.net/Ambermoon/) with his Savegame editor
- Alex Holland from the [Thalion Webshrine](http://thalion.exotica.org.uk/)
- and many others (if you know anyone I forgot, please let me know)

I just want to gather the whole findings at a central place and provide it on a save storage for the future.

At least some contributions will come from me as well like some file specs and the formatting of all the data. :)

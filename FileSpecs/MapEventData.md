# Map event data

Data for map events is stored in the map data files. See [Maps](Maps.md) for more details.

1 | Global variable (game variable)
7 | Use item (from inventory)
9 | Treasure looted (chained after a treasures)

## Action event (0x0E / 14)

Actions are related to conditions. For example they can change variable values which are used in conditions.

Offset | Type | Description
--- | --- | ---

0x01 | ubyte | Action value (e.g. variable value to set)
0x02 | ubyte[4] | **Unknown**
0x05 | ubyte | Object index (depends on action's type, e.g. variable index)

## Question popup event (0x13 / 19)

Text popup as question with buttons 'Yes' and 'No'.

- Popup size
- Button texts

Offset | Type | Description
--- | --- | ---
0x00 | byte | Map text index
0x05 | ubyte[8] | **Unknown**

## Change music event (0x14 / 20)

Changes the currently played music. If the music index 0xff is given,
the default music of the current map is used (= music reset to normal).

There is a byte that is always 0xff. I guessed that this might be the volume. But as it is always 0xff in Ambermoon this could be anything. This could only be tested if the original data is manipulated and then in Ambermoon the volume is checked.

Offset | Type | Description
--- | --- | ---
0x00 | word | Music index (0x00ff = default map music)
0x02 | byte | Volume (always 0xff -> 100%, not sure about this)
0x03 | ubyte[6] | Unused
